  <h3 style="font-family:arial;" style="font-size:170%;">You can use this website to learn more about my goals to create an app for mobile phones to help increase awareness and membership to
West Valley Boys and Girls Club.

Utilizing coding skills, the mobile app will help gather membership information to
as data.

The app will also provide events coming up in the community for awareness and
volunteer opportunities for involvement in community.

Track the hours of community service the students have.There will be two
accounts. An account for the Boys and Girls Club staff members and for the boys
and girls club members.
    
    Many students in the past have lost their hours of community service with the
Boys and Girls Club or are not aware of the opportunities available. By creating an
app that would automatically track their hours would allow the Boys and Girls club to
have a system that is effective.
