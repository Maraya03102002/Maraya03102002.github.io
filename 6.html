                    <h3> What was the project budget?</h3>
                  
             <p> - In the beginning of our second year of Northrop Grumman we were given an option of either working with an arduino board or raspberry pi. Given the base parts we could only spend the $200 on extra materials.
                   
                   For my project my mentors and I decided that it would be best to use an Arduino for my project.

   <td> The Arduino Uno wifi allows adding wifi to devices. It's basically an Arduino Uno Rev3 with more kick: It comes with a brand new 8-bit microprocessor from Microchip, and an onboard IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit). As for the WiFi connection, that's made secure with the new ECC608 crypto chip accelerator. </td>
