                    <h3> What a problem you noticed in your community/school?</h3>
                  
             <p> - In the beginning of our second year of Northrop Grumman we were given an option of either working with an arduino board or raspberry pi. Given the base parts we could only spend the $200 on extra materials.
                   
                   For my project my mentors and I decided that it would be best to use an Arduino for my project.
