When I first joined my high schoolâ€™s robotics team, my mechanics skills were definitely lacking. However, I worked hard and learned from the veteran members involved. As a result I became District president of Skills USA and Canoga Park Robotics Team in Spring 2018, I became the team captain. As captain, I now work to understand the strengths and weaknesses of my team members and help everyone to improve. I encourage everyone to be inclusive and work together. To address the stereotypes of women in STEM, I encourage our female members to be hands-on in cutting and wiring our robot. On our team, we teach one another and have built a sense of comradery and safe learning space for everyone.I also have an immense appreciation towards my mentors who supoorted and encouraged me to go far and beyond no matter how many times you fail. During my first year in Northrup Grumman i learned that we should'nt be ashamed of failure but rather embrace it because it really reflects how resilient and determined a person is.
