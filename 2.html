When I first joined the Canoga Park High School robotics team, my mechanics skills were definitely lacking. I had little understanding of mechanics or physics. However, I didnâ€™t let my lack of experience discourage me. 
I worked hard and learned from the veteran members on my robotics team. In the Fall of 2017, I became the team captain. As captain, I understood the strengths and weaknesses of my team members and encouraged teamwork and inclusivity (especially encouraging other women on the team). On our team, we teach one another and have built a sense of comradery and a safe learning space for everyone.
As a result of my engagement with the robotics team, my coach encouraged me to apply for the Northrop Grumman High School Involvement Partnership (HIP) internship. Out of a large pool of applicants, three students were chosen for the internship, including myself. I was assigned two mentors who taught me so much as worked on various engineering projects. In my first year, I worked on mechanical engineering projects that involved electrical techniques and coding program skills. I have now built robots that maneuver through obstacle courses and other robots that can collect and launch balls.  Throughout my two-year internship, I have sometimes struggled or even failed, but I always managed to seek help from my mentors and learn from my mistakes.
I am now more passionate than ever about engineering - a profession I know will play a critical role in the future of our society. Pursuing a career in engineering will also help me empower women; I plan to advocate for and help educate girls in low-income communities, encouraging them to confidently enter the STEM field. 
My dream is to change the statistics of Latina women in STEM careers. To accomplish this dream, I have made it my personal goal in college to reach out to low-income youth, especially girls, and give them the courage and skills to enter this exciting field.
