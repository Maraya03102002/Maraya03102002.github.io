I’ve been working with three types of programming languages, Python, HTML, CSS. Python is a high-level programming language which focuses more on the functionality of an application through common programming tasks. HTML focuses on the content of a page while CSS focuses more on the structure of creating the website. So far, I’ve been enjoying coding and have developed new skills through these programs though I’ve difficulty remembering small details.
